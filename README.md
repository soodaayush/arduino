## Inspiration

I was tasked with producing a physical project for my Yoga exam, which is to demonstrate what I have learnt from the course. I thought making a reminder using an Arduino would be a great idea, since it makes for a good starter project.

## Challenges

The challenges faced when creating this was connecting the wires to their respective spots and making sure they don't become loose.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the basics of how hardware works and how to print to an LED screen.

## The Project

Built this for a final Yoga exam in school, the LED screen is powered by wires from the Arduino, which is loaded with instructions to print Yoga reminders. It reminds you to remember to meditate.
