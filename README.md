## Inspiration

I was tasked with producing a physical project for my Yoga exam, which is to demonstrate what I have learnt from the course. I thought making a reminder using an Arduino would be a great idea, since it makes for a good starter project.

## Challenges

The challenges faced when creating this was connecting the wires to their respective spots and making sure they don't become loose.

## The Project

Built this for a final Yoga project in school, this displays reminders tell you meditate, stretch, etc.
